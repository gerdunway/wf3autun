Making anaother change locally while a change on the server side was made as well

I'll make a change without knowing that Stephan had made a change as well on his side and update the server file

Will see the changes made locally with this line


/* Modification made by me locally, which conflicted */

A new line to learn something else

/* Modification made by Stephan */

tsusss!!!!!!
